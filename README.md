# Open Grants List

The Open Grants List is a list of grants that are openly available on the web.
These grants can help with learning grantsmanship, understanding particular funders and their programs, and communicating research and scholarship.

The main website is <https://www.ogrants.org/>.

This is the Jekyll repository that creates the site.

## Adding a grant

Adding a grant to the list requires two (or three) things:

### 1. Post the grant online

This site doesn't host grants, it just provides links to them.
We recommend [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) as good options for posting grants because they are archival and so shouldn't result in broken links anytime in the near future.

### 2. Add information about the grant

Information for each grant is stored as YAML with fields for each key piece of information.
E.g.,

```markdown
---
layout: grant
title: Moore Investigator in Data Driven Discovery
author: Ethan P. White
ORCID: 0000-0001-6728-7745
year: 2014
link: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1189330
funder: Moore Foundation
program: Data Driven Discovery Investigators
discipline: data science
status: funded
---
```

The items to the right of the `:` on each line should be changed to match the grant you want to add.
To get this added to the site there are three options:

1. Submit a pull request that adds the above information to a file named `lastname_firstname_year.md` in the `_grants` folder of this GitHub repository.
  The `lastname` and `firstname` should be those for the lead PI.
  In the case of multiple grants by the same PI for the same year append letters in order to the date, e.g., `white_ethan_2026a.md`.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/ogrants/ogrants/issues/new) and paste the filled out YAML into that issue.
3. [Email us](mailto:ogrants@googlegroups.com) the information.

### 3. Add information about the author

If you want you can also add information about the author in the form:

```markdown
---
name: Ethan P. White
ORCID: 0000-0001-6728-7745
institution: University of Florida
website: http://ethanwhite.org
twitter: ethanwhite
---
```

This can be submitted along with the grant information if you're using an issue or email.
If you're submitting a pull request it should be placed in a file named `lastname_firstname.md` in the `_authors` directory.
