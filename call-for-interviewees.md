title: Call for Interviewees for Research Study “Planning for Open Grants”
---
We would like to invite interested researchers and stakeholders to participate in an interview for our project **"Planning for Open Grants: Fostering a Transparent and Accessible National Research Proposal Infrastructure"**, reviewed and approved by the University of Florida Institutional Research Board (approval number IRB202201494).

The aims of the project are to understand how a repository or similar infrastructure that shares grant proposals will impact researchers and the broader research ecosystem.

You would participate in a 45-minute interview, over Zoom or phone, to discuss your knowledge and expertise in different facets of grantmaking.

Our research team is formed by:
* Hao Ye, PhD, Reproducibility Librarian, University of Florida, <haoye@ufl.edu>
* Perry Collins, MLIS, Copyright and OER Librarian, University of Florida, <perrycollins@ufl.edu>
* Natalia Uribe-Castañeda, PhD Student, University of Florida, <nuribecastaneda@ufl.edu>

More information about the study can be found at [assets/IRB_subject-information.docx](assets/IRB_subject-information.docx)

To participate, please email Hao Ye <haoye@ufl.edu> with the subject “{YOUR NAME} Interview Request for Research Study Planning for Open Grants”, and a member of our research team will reach out to schedule an interview time.
